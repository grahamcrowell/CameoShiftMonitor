# GraphQL Dev Server

Simple local [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/server/) for [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) using [Express](https://expressjs.com/).  Based on [Apollo Docs Example](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/example.html).

This is a local mock up of the PROD GraphQL API deployed to [AppSync](???) that is logically separate (different `package.json`) for all other code in the repo.

## Quick Start

```bash 
cd dev_server
node server.js
```

### GraphiQL

To browse mock server API browse to [GraphiQL IDE](localhost:3000/graphiql).
